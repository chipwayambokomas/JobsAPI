# JobsAPI

In this final project in my online course I created an API for a Job tracker, it allows a user to login or register and once done the server will pass a jsonWebToken to the user allowing the user to create, delete, edit and display jobs only for said user.

# API Documentation

You can view the API documentation when launching the application in your IDE or you can simply follow the link below to the live application hosted on the Heroku cloud:
